This project involves a system for managing the relationships between a high school (Lycee), its parents, and their children (students).
The Lycee class stores the name of the school, a set of parents, and a map of delegates (representatives). 
The Parent class includes details like the parent's name, ID (CIN), type (Father, Mother, or Guardian), and a set of children. The Eleve class represents a student with attributes such as ID, name, and a reference to their parent. 
The system allows for adding and managing parents and their children, designating delegate parents, and calculating the percentage distribution of parent types.
Exception handling is included to manage cases where a parent does not exist when adding a delegate. The project emphasizes organized data storage and retrieval, proper handling of exceptions, and clear categorization of parent types.
